            <p id="abouttxt">Hello, my name is Arun. I am an aspiring software engineer and video gaming ethusiast. 
                I graduated from California State Univeristy, Fullerton with a Bachelor of Science in computer science.
                During my academic career, I was able to complete a wide variety of projects including a compiler, Go bot and simple FTP server. 
                Many of these projects were written in C++ or Python, which are my two strongest programming languages.
